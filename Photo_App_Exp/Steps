F.I.R.S.T Principles
--------------------

1) Fast
2) Isolate / Independent
3) Repeatable
4) Self-validator
5) Thorough / Timely -> Test coverage. Thorough should cover positive, negative, edge cases, security issues, illegal arguments and variables. In terms of time we should write test first and then write production code.


Red -> Green -> Refactor -> Repeat

Red: Write unit tests that can be failed
Green: Write unit tests that can be passed
Refator: Clean up and improve both unit test code and production code

100% Code Coverage: 100% of the code was tested(every line).

AAA: Arange / Act / Assert
